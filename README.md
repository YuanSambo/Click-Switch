# Switch & Click
A game made in 3 days for my entry to My First Game Jam: Summer 2020 and this is my first time participating in a game jam.

A point and click game where you switch colors until they match the enemies color then click all the way to destroy them !

Controls :

Switch colors - Space

Destroy - Left Mouse Button

Start / Play Again - Enter

Note: This game is still under development and I maybe  will add some features in the future. All feedback and comments are truly appreciated Thank you for playing I hope you enjoy it!
